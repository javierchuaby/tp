**ClubTrack is a desktop application for managing club members and attendance, optimized for university student club executive committee (exco) members.** While it has a GUI, most of the user interactions happen using a CLI (Command Line Interface).

## Key Features

* **Member Management**: Add, edit, and organize member information including contact details, year of study, and faculty
* **Multi-Event Lists**: Switch between different event rosters and attendance lists seamlessly
* **Attendance Tracking**: Mark members as present or absent for different events and meetings
* **Points System**: Award and deduct participation points to track member engagement
* **Tag-Based Organization**: Organize members by roles (e.g., committee positions) and search by tag prefixes
* **Fast CLI Operations**: Perform all operations quickly through intuitive command-line interface

## Target Users

ClubTrack is designed for **university student club executive committee (exco) members** who:
- Manage large member databases (50-500 members)
- Track attendance across multiple events and sessions
- Assign roles and responsibilities to members
- Monitor member participation through points systems
- Prefer keyboard input over mouse clicking for faster operations
